# CapFinal

Arduino code for I2C protocol with interfacing strain gauges, HX711, and MPU6050. The updated slave device code is located in the "slaveMegaFin" folder. The updated master device code is located in the "MasterMultiLoggerFin" folder.

"GraphFinal" is a Processing code that will bring up a GUI for the data that is being processed.

In order for these codes to work, you must import the HX711 library and MPU6050 library to your Arduino IDE.

Our system consisted of 320 resistors, potentiometers,  350 ohm strain gauge, a metal bar and clamp, an MPU6050 accelerometer, HX711 ADC/Amplifiers, an Arduino Uno, and an Arduino Mega.

The similar layout is shown in the fritzing application attached to this repository.
